"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.  A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.  You have to start over with a working simple system" - John Gall

Writing tests before coding leads to testable (verifiable) code.

Quotes from Specification by Example by Gojko Adzic.

"Specifications should be about business functionality, not software design"
It allows developers to find the best possible solution.
It allows developers to improve the design in the future.

"Complex specifications are hard to understand, so most people won’t be able to
identify functional gaps and inconsistencies in such specifications."

"Specification by Example relies heavily on collaboration between business
users and delivery team members."

"Using real data is important on data-driven projects, when a great deal can de-
pend on slight variations and inconsistencies."

"A good specification, with examples, is effectively an acceptance test for
the described functionality."
